pcapng file. Opened it with wireshark. It is a TFTP connection. Extraced 3 bin files, 2 text files by setting filter on top to tftp.type.
2 text files, rot13 encrypted. Decrypting them tells us there is some secret hidden flag in the bmp files.

Going to use binwalk, exiftool, strings, file and xxd to see if there is any data to extract.

Binwalk shows something interesting for the picture2.bmp file, but not much for the other 2.
File command doesnt tell us much, nor does exiftool.
Strings command shows a couple of entries for keyword flag when ran on the second picture.
Xxd does not really seem to tell us much.
