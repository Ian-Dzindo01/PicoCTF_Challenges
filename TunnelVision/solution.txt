Unknown data type. Upon catting the head of the file we see the first letters are BM which indicates it is a bitmap file.
We use ImageMagick to open the file and see half and image and a false flag.
Size of the file is 2 Mb and image dimension is 1134x306. There is something more hidden in this file, need to find a way to bring it out.
Trying to manipulate hex to see if there is something to be brought out.
We use HexEdit to manipulate the hex and change the image height.
ImageMagick cannot open the file, hence we try another editor. Photopea seems to work good and opens the image with the flag written onto it.
More info about which hex values to manipualte can be found on the BMP Wikipedia page.
